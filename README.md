### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to React. SlickGrid beats most other datagrids in terms of features, customizability and performance (it can easily deal with even a million row). Slickgrid-React is a wrapper on top of SlickGrid and it requires [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) dependency, originally we used the `6pac/SlickGrid` fork but that was dropped in >=7.0, so we no longer need external SlickGrid dependencies anymore apart from Slickgrid-Universal since [v4.0](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/releases/tag/v4.0.2). Also, SlickGrid was recently refactored to be browser native, which means that jQuery is no longer required in Slickgrid-React v3.0 and higher.

The [Docs - Quick Start](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-react/getting-started/quick-start) is a great place to start with.

## Main features
You can see some screenshots below and visit the [Documentation](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-react/getting-started/quick-start) website.

## Missing features
What if `Slickgrid-React` is missing feature(s) compare to the original core library [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/)?

Fear not, you can always reference the `SlickGrid` and `DataView` instances, just like in the core lib, those are exposed through Events. For more info head over to the [Docs - SlickGrid & DataView objects](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-react/slick-grid-dataview-objects/slickgrid-dataview-objects) and [Docs - Grid & DataView Events](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/slickgrid-react/events/grid-dataview-events)
