### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to React. SlickGrid beats most other datagrids in terms of features, customizability and performance (it can easily deal with even a million row). Slickgrid-React is a wrapper on top of SlickGrid and it requires [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) dependency, originally we used the `6pac/SlickGrid` fork but that was dropped in >=7.0, so we no longer need external SlickGrid dependencies anymore apart from Slickgrid-Universal since [v4.0](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react/releases/tag/v4.0.2). SlickGrid was also recently refactored to be browser native (no more jQuery).
